# Contact-Centre-Project
This project seeks to build an interactive call centre audit executive Dashboard using Tableau by combining interactions from a real life contact centre on three different touchpoints.

The datasets were collected as a power query file and some pre-cleaning activities were carried out using Microsoft excel for data protection.

Each column in the dataset contains information provided by the member of the Quality assurance team on information on interactions monitored on call, email and social media chat interactions

The files were then converted to csv formats before importing them to jupyter notebook and merged to one dataset.

Data wrangling and cleaning activities were carrieb out before creating an interactive Dashboard on Tableau
